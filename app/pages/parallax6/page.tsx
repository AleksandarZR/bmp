                            Venom is a character appearing in American comic
                            books published by Marvel Comics. The character is a
                            sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous,
                            liquid-like form, who survives by bonding with a
                            host, usually human. This dual-life form receives
                            enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as
                            "Venom". The symbiote was originally introduced as a
                            living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man #252
                            (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in
                            The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988).

                            The Venom symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man
                            himself, who eventually discovered its true
                            nefarious nature and separated himself from the
                            creature in The Amazing Spider-Man #258 (November
                            1984)[2]â€”with a brief rejoining five months later in
                            Web of Spider-Man #1.[3] The symbiote went on to
                            merge with other hosts, beginning with Eddie Brock,
                            its second and best-known host, with whom it first
                            became Venom
